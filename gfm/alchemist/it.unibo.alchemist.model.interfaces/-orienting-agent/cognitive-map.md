The cognitive map of the agent. It's a graph composed of landmarks (elements of the environment easy to remember due to their uniqueness) and spatial relations between them. It's modeled as a [NavigationGraph](../../it.unibo.alchemist.model.interfaces.geometry.euclidean2d.graph/-navigation-graph/index.md).
