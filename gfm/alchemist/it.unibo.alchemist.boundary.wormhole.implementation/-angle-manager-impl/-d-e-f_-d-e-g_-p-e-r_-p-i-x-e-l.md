[jvm]\
val [DEF_DEG_PER_PIXEL](-d-e-f_-d-e-g_-p-e-r_-p-i-x-e-l.md): [Double](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-double/index.html)

DEF_DEG_PER_PIXEL = "DEFault amount of DEGrees PER PIXEL". Currently set to 3 * 360 / screenWidth i.e.: by sliding the mouse through the entire width of the screen you will obtain a 3 rounds rotation. This constant is intended for an implementation that converts mouse motion over x axis into degrees.
