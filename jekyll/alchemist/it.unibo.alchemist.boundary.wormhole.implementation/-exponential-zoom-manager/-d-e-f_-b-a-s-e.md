# DEF_BASE



[jvm]\
val [DEF_BASE](-d-e-f_-b-a-s-e.html): [Double](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-double/index.html)



DEF_BASE = "DEFault BASE". It is the default base for the exponential function. It is meant to be greater than 1. Currently its value is {@value #DEF_BASE} that seems pretty good to me.
