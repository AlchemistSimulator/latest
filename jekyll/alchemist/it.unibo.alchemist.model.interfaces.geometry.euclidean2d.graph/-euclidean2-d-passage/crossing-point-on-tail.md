# crossingPointOnTail



[jvm]\
fun [crossingPointOnTail](crossing-point-on-tail.html)(position: [Euclidean2DPosition](../../it.unibo.alchemist.model.implementations.positions/-euclidean2-d-position/index.html)): [Euclidean2DPosition](../../it.unibo.alchemist.model.implementations.positions/-euclidean2-d-position/index.html)



Provided the [position](crossing-point-on-tail.html) of an agent that may want to cross this passage, this method computes the point belonging to [passageShapeOnTail](passage-shape-on-tail.html) which is more convenient to cross. Note that the agent must be inside [tail](tail.html).
