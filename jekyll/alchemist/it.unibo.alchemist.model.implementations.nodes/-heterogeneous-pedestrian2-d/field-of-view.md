# fieldOfView

open override val [fieldOfView](field-of-view.html): [FieldOfView2D](../../it.unibo.alchemist.model.implementations.geometry.euclidean2d/-field-of-view2-d/index.html)<[T](index.html)>



The field of view of a pedestrian in the Euclidean world. Implementors should override this property to prevent the continuous creation of new FieldOfView2Ds.
