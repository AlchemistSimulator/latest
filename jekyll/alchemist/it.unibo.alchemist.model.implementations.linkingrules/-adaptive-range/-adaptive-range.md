# AdaptiveRange



[jvm]\
open fun [AdaptiveRange](-adaptive-range.html)(radius: [Double](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-double/index.html), minrange: [Double](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-double/index.html), maxrange: [Double](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-double/index.html), num: [Int](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-int/index.html), tolerance: [Int](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-int/index.html))



## Parameters


jvm

| | |
|---|---|
| radius | default radius in metres |
| minrange | minimum radius in metres |
| maxrange | maximum radius in metres |
| num | preferred number of neighbors |
| tolerance | if the number of neighbors is smaller than num-tolerance, the radius is increased; if the number of neighbors is higher than num+tolerance, the radius is decreased |
