                        <p>As a first step, we recommend learning the YAML basics.
The language is so simple and human readable that there is probably no better way to learn it than to read it directly.
My suggestion is to use the tutorial &quot;<a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/">Learn X in Y minutes where X = YAML</a>&quot;,
it should provide a good YAML guide (surely sufficient to follow the tutorial).</p>
<p>Alchemist expects a YAML map as input. In the following section, we'll discuss which keys it expects.
Of course, users are free to use all the YAML features (e.g. anchors and merge keys)
to organize their code and reduce duplication.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-an-incarnation"><a href="#choosing-an-incarnation" id="choosing-an-incarnation" class="anchor"></a>Choosing an incarnation</h2>
<p>The <code>incarnation</code> key is mandatory.
Actually, it's the only mandatory key.
The YAML parser expects a string value.
Such string will be used to get the most similarly named incarnation, namely the subclass of Incarnation whose simple
name is closest to the string.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">incarnation: sapere
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">incarnation: protelis
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">incarnation: biochemistry
</code></pre>
<p><em>Note:</em> this is also the most minimal valid alchemist specification</p>
<h2 id="loading-arbitrary-java-classes-with-the-typeparameters-syntax"><a href="#loading-arbitrary-java-classes-with-the-typeparameters-syntax" id="loading-arbitrary-java-classes-with-the-typeparameters-syntax" class="anchor"></a>Loading arbitrary Java classes with the <code>type</code>/<code>parameters</code> syntax</h2>
<p>Alchemist YAML lets the user control which actual Java classes should be
loaded inside a simulation, and which constructor should be used to do so.
Almost every entity of an Alchemist simulation can be instanced through arbitrary Java classes implementing the required interfaces.
When the alchemist parser encounters a map providing the keys <code>type</code> and <code>parameters</code>, it tries to resolve the
value of the value associated to <code>type</code> to a class name, then tries to create the object by
searching a constructor compatible with the parameters known by the context plus those provided in <code>parameters</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Class name resolution</strong></p>
<p>The value associated with <code>type</code> must be a string representing a valid Java identifier.
If the value contains one or more <code>.</code> characters, then it will be interpreted as a fully qualified name.
If no such character is included, then it will be interpreted as a simple name.
Multiple classes with a common supertype and the same simple name may conflict, in which case the simulator raises an error.</p>
<p><strong>Object instancing</strong></p>
<p>If the class gets loaded correctly, then its constructors get sorted based on the number and type of parameters.
The system tries to build an object with all the available constructors until one of them provides an instanced object,
in an order that considers both the current context (namely, the entities that have already been instanced) and the
value of <code>parameters</code>.</p>
<p>For instance, imagine that you are trying to build an instance of a Reaction, whose only constructor requires an
Environment, a Node, an <code>int</code> and a <code>String</code>.
In this case, an Environment and a Node must have already been created
(or the simulation loading process would have failed already).
As a consequence, the first two parameters are automatically inferred by the current context and passed to the constructor.
The other two parameters can not be inferred this way;
instead, the value associated to <code>parameters</code> is used to extract the proper values (if possible).
In this case, this would have been a valid <code>parameters</code> entry:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">type: my.package.MyCustomReaction
parameters: [4, foo]
</code></pre>
<p>As you can easily infer, the value of <code>parameters</code> must be a YAML list.</p>
<p>Don't despair if the class loading system is still unclear: it will become clearer with the examples in the forthcoming sections.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-environment"><a href="#setting-up-the-environment" id="setting-up-the-environment" class="anchor"></a>Setting up the environment</h2>
<p>The <code>environment</code> key is used to load the Environment implementation.
It is optional and it defaults to a continuous bidimensional space.</p>
<h3 id="examples"><a href="#examples" id="examples" class="anchor"></a>Examples</h3>
<p>The following simulations are equivalent, and load the default environment (which is incarnation independent, here
<code>protelis</code> is picked, but it works for any other incarnation as well):</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">incarnation: protelis
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">incarnation: protelis
environment:
  type: Continuous2DEnvironment
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">incarnation: protelis
environment:
  type: it.unibo.alchemist.model.implementations.environments.Continuous2DEnvironment
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">incarnation: protelis
environment:
  type: Continuous2DEnvironment
  parameters: []
</code></pre>
<p>Alchemist supports
<a href="https://alchemistsimulator.github.io/latest/wiki/advanced/maps">real world maps</a>
and
<a href="https://alchemistsimulator.github.io/latest/wiki/advanced/indoor">indoor environments with obstacles</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, in case you have a custom Environment implementation,
you can load it using the <code>type</code>/<code>parameters</code> syntax.</p>
<p>The environments shipped with the distribution can be found in the package
it.unibo.alchemist.model.implementations.environments.</p>
<h2 id="deploying-nodes"><a href="#deploying-nodes" id="deploying-nodes" class="anchor"></a>Deploying nodes</h2>
<p>Once the environment is set up, it is time to populate it with nodes.
The <code>deployments</code> section lists the node locations at the beginning of the simulation.
Each deployment type extends the interface Deployment.</p>
<h3 id="deploying-on-specific-positions"><a href="#deploying-on-specific-positions" id="deploying-on-specific-positions" class="anchor"></a>Deploying on specific positions</h3>
<p>The following example places a single node in the (0, 0) Point.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">incarnation: protelis
deployments:
  type: Point
  parameters: [0, 0]
</code></pre>
<p>Multiple nodes can be set up by listing them in YAML list, or in a YAML map,
or in an arbitrarily nested combination of the two.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">incarnation: sapere # The incarnation is always mandatory
network-model:
  type: ConnectWithinDistance # Loads a class with this name implementing LinkingRule
  parameters: [2] # Connection radius (parameter of a ConnectWithinDistance's constructor)
deployments:
  - type: Point # Loads a class with this name implementing Deployment
    parameters: [0, 0] # Coordinates
  - { type: Point, parameters: [0.5, 0.85] }
  - { type: Point, parameters: [-0.5, 0.85] }
</code></pre>
<p>The Alchemist loading system is smart enough to search for deployments recursively.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">incarnation: protelis
deployments:
  the_bottom_point:
    type: Point
    parameters: [0, 0]
  the_top_points:
    - type: Point
      parameters: [0.5, 0.85]
    - type: Point
      parameters: [-0.5, 0.85]
</code></pre>
<p>If multiple nodes are to be deployed with the same contents and program in multiple arbitrarily picked locations,
a dedicated Deployment with arbitrary positions is present:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">incarnation: sapere
deployments:
  type: SpecificPositions
  parameters: [[0,1],[2,2],[3,4]]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="deploying-a-grid-of-nodes"><a href="#deploying-a-grid-of-nodes" id="deploying-a-grid-of-nodes" class="anchor"></a>Deploying a grid of nodes</h3>
<p>Here instead nodes are located in a Grid centered in (0, 0), with nodes distanced of 0.25 both
horizontally and vertically.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">incarnation: sapere
deployments:
  type: Grid
  parameters: [-5, -5, 5, 5, 0.25, 0.25]
</code></pre>
<p>Often however, symmetric structures may induce corner behaviors in self-organising systems,
and real-world &quot;grid&quot; deployments are not usually geometrically perfect.
It is easy in Alchemist to create a perturbed grid, for instance in the following example nodes' positions
are not exactly in the grid, but randomly perturbed (±0.1 distance units).</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">incarnation: sapere
deployments:
  type: Grid
  parameters: [-5, -5, 5, 5, 0.25, 0.25, 0.1, 0.1]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="deploying-nodes-randomly-inside-a-shape"><a href="#deploying-nodes-randomly-inside-a-shape" id="deploying-nodes-randomly-inside-a-shape" class="anchor"></a>Deploying nodes randomly inside a shape</h3>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to deploy a bunch of nodes randomly inside some area marked by a shape.
Circles and polygons are first-class citizens,
but of course users may create their own deployments by implementing Deployment.</p>
<p>This example places 1000 nodes randomly in a Circle with center in (0, 0) and radius 10.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">incarnation: sapere
deployments:
  type: Circle
  parameters: [1000, 0, 0, 10]
</code></pre>
<p>In the following example, they are instead deployed randomly within a 10x20 rectangle originating in (0,0).</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">incarnation: sapere
deployments:
  type: Rectangle
  parameters: [1000, 0, 0, 10, 20]
</code></pre>
<p>Polygons can be used by providing all vertices.
In the following example we anticipate some advanced features of the simulator by deploying some nodes within
the Venice lagoon.</p>

<h3 id="customizing-the-node-type"><a href="#customizing-the-node-type" id="customizing-the-node-type" class="anchor"></a>Customizing the node type</h3>
<p>In order to specify a particular node implementation you want to put inside the environment you can use the <code>nodes</code> key
followed by the name of the class, and the parameters required to build it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">deployments:
  type: ...
  parameters: ...
  nodes:
    type: MyCustomNodeImpl
    parameters: [...]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="customizing-the-nodes-content"><a href="#customizing-the-nodes-content" id="customizing-the-nodes-content" class="anchor"></a>Customizing the nodes' content</h3>
<p>It is possible to set the content of the nodes in a deployment.
Node contents are defined in terms of molecules and their corresponding concentration.
As such, they depend on the specific incarnation in use.</p>
<p>In the following example, we inject in all the nodes of a Grid deployment a molecule called <code>foo</code>  with
concentration <code>1</code>.
As stated before, it would only make sense if the incarnation supports integer concentrations and it's able to produce
a valid molecule from the <code>&quot;foo&quot;</code> String.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">deployments:
  - type: Grid
    parameters: [-5, -5, 5, 5, 0.25, 0.25, 0.1, 0.1]
    contents:
      - molecule: foo
        concentration: 1
</code></pre>
<p>Multiple contents can be listed, e.g.,
if we want to also have a molecule named <code>bar</code> with value <code>0</code> along with <code>foo</code>,
we can just add another entry to the list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">deployments:
  - type: Grid
    parameters: [-5, -5, 5, 5, 0.25, 0.25, 0.1, 0.1]
    contents:
      - molecule: foo
        concentration: 1
      - molecule: bar
        concentration: 0
</code></pre>
<p>Molecules can be injected selectively inside a given Shape.
To do so, you can a filter with the <code>in keyword</code>.
In the following example, only the nodes inside the Rectangle area contain
the <code>source</code> molecule.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">deployments:
  - type: Grid
    parameters: [-5, -5, 5, 5, 0.25, 0.25, 0.1, 0.1]
    contents:
      - in:
          type: Rectangle
          parameters: [-6, -6, 2, 2]
        molecule: source
        concentration: true
</code></pre>
<h2 id="defining-the-network"><a href="#defining-the-network" id="defining-the-network" class="anchor"></a>Defining the network</h2>
<p>The <code>network-model</code> key is used to load the implementation of LinkingRule to be used in the simulation,
which determines the neighborhood of every node.
The key is optional, but defaults to NoLinks, so if unspecified nodes in the environment don't get
connected.
Omitting such key is equivalent to writing any of the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">network-model:
  type: NoLinks
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">network-model:
  type: it.unibo.alchemist.model.implementations.linkingrules.NoLinks
  parameters: []
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">network-model:
  type: NoLinks
  parameters: []
</code></pre>
<p>If no fully qualified linking rule name is provided for class loading, Alchemist uses the package
it.unibo.alchemist.model.implementations.linkingrules to search for the class.</p>
<h3 id="linking-nodes-based-on-distance"><a href="#linking-nodes-based-on-distance" id="linking-nodes-based-on-distance" class="anchor"></a>Linking nodes based on distance</h3>
<p>One of the most common ways of linking nodes is to connect those which are close enough to each other. To do so, you can
use the class ConnectWithinDistance, passing a parameter representing the maximum connection distance.
Note that such distance depends on the environment: while the definition of distance is straightforward for euclidean
spaces, it's not so for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemannian_geometry">Riemannian manifolds</a>, which is a fancy
name to define geometries such as the one typical of a urban map (you can roughly interpret it as a euclidean space
&quot;with holes&quot;).
For instance, in case of environments using GeoPosition, the distance is computed in meters, so the
distance between <code>[44.133254, 12.237770]</code> and <code>[44.146680, 12.258627]</code> is about <code>2240</code> (meters).</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">network-model:
  type: ConnectWithinDistance
  # Link together all the nodes closer than 100 according to the distance function
  parameters: [100]
</code></pre>
<h2 id="writing-behaviors-reactions"><a href="#writing-behaviors-reactions" id="writing-behaviors-reactions" class="anchor"></a>Writing behaviors (Reactions)</h2>
<p>Nodes can be programmed using reactions.
Reaction are usually highly dependent on the specific incarnation.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml"># Variable representing the program to be executed

      actions:

          parameters: [...] #
</code></pre>
<h2 id="layers"><a href="#layers" id="layers" class="anchor"></a>Layers</h2>
<p>It is possible to define overlays (layers) of data that can be sensed everywhere in the environment.
Layers can be used to model physical properties, such as pollution, light, temperature, and so on.
Conversely than readings from nodes' contents, layers have no dependency optimization.
This implies that reactions that read values from layers should have special care in defining their <code>context</code> appropriately</p>
<p>In order to create layer, the programmer must define the type of the layer, a molecule that will be used as identifier,
and possibly the parameters needed for intializing the type of layer you have chosen, as per the <a href="#loading-arbitrary-java-classes-with-the-typeparameters-syntax"><code>type/parameter</code> syntax</a>.</p>
<p>The following example exemplifies the syntax for initializing two BidimensionalGaussianLayer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">layers:
  - type: BidimensionalGaussianLayer
    molecule: foo
    parameters: [0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 5.0]
  - type: BidimensionalGaussianLayer
    molecule: bar
    parameters: [0.0, 0.0, 5.0, 10.0]

<h2 id="terminating-the-simulation-if-a-condition-is-met"><a href="#terminating-the-simulation-if-a-condition-is-met" id="terminating-the-simulation-if-a-condition-is-met" class="anchor"></a>Terminating the simulation if a condition is met</h2>
<p>Alchemist supports the possibility to write termination conditions for any simulation.
Termination conditions are checked after every event, and, if met, cause the immediate termination of a simulation.
Termination conditions are expected to be found in the it.unibo.alchemist.model.implementations.terminators package.</p>
<p>To load them, use the <code>terminators</code> keyword.
Multiple terminators are allowed, the first terminator matching causes the termination of the simulation (they are in and).</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">terminate:
  # Defines a new terminator which every 100 simulation steps for the environment to remain equal for the 10 subsequent
  # simulation steps. If no change is detected, then the simulation is intended as concluded.
  - type: StableForSteps
    parameters: [100, 10]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="terminating-the-simulation-after-some-time"><a href="#terminating-the-simulation-after-some-time" id="terminating-the-simulation-after-some-time" class="anchor"></a>Terminating the simulation after some time</h3>
<p>One of the simplest terminators availables allows for declaring a simulation completed when a certain simulated time is reached.
In the following example, it is used in conjunction with a number of variables, showing how it's possible to use such
variables to produce batches of simulations terminating at different times.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">variables:
  stabilizationTime:
    type: ArbitraryVariable
    parameters: [10, [0, 1, 10, 100, 1000]]
  simulationEnd: &amp;simulationEnd
    formula: 150 + stabilizationTime

<p>A terminator is provided for terminating when a simulation is &quot;stable&quot; (nothing changes in terms of positions and nodes' content).
The class implementing it is StableForSteps.
The following code snippet exemplifies its usage:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">terminate:
  # Defines a new terminator which every 100 simulation steps for the environment to remain equal for the 10 subsequent
  # simulation steps. If no change is detected, then the simulation is intended as concluded.
  - type: StableForSteps
    parameters: [100, 10]

<h2 id="controlling-the-reproducibility"><a href="#controlling-the-reproducibility" id="controlling-the-reproducibility" class="anchor"></a>Controlling the reproducibility</h2>
<p>Alchemist simulations can be reproduced by feeding them the same random number generator.
This assumption is true as far as the custom component in use:</p>
<ul>
<li>do not use any other random generators but the one provided by the simulation framework (all the standard components are guaranteed to do so);</li>
<li>do not iterate over collections with no predicible iteration order (i.e., <code>Set</code> and <code>Map</code>) containing elements (or
keys) whose <code>hashCode()</code> has not been overridden to return the same value regardless of the specific JVM in use;</li>
<li>do not run operations in parallel.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>seeds</code> section may contain two optional values: <code>scenario</code> and <code>simulation</code>.
The former is the seed of the pseudo-random generator used during the creation of the simulation, e.g. for deploying
nodes in random arrangements.
The latter is the seed of the pseudo-random generator used during the simulation, e.g. for computing time distributions
or generating random positions.
A typical example in which one may want to have different values, is to keep the same random deployment of devices in
some scenario but allow events to happen with different timings.</p>
<p>A typical <code>seed</code> section may look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">seeds:
  scenario: 0
  simulation: 1
</code></pre>
<p>Usually, in batches, you wan to run multiple runs per experiment, varying the simulation seed, in order to get more
reliable data (and appropriate error bars).
As per any other value, variables can be feeded as random generator seeds.
In the following example, 100 simulations are generated with different seeds (both for environment configuration and
simulation execution)</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">variables:
  random: &amp;random
    min: 0
    max: 9
    step: 1
    default: 0
seeds:
  # reference to the `random` variable
  scenario: *random
  simulation: *random
</code></pre>
